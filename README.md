# ZeusMod
a Craftbukkit/Spigot server plugin making OPs more godlike

# Ingame commands
The ZeusMod plugin only uses the `/zspeed <walk> <fly>` command which sets (in percents) the walk/flight speed when holding the control item.
If only one number is given it then sets both walk and flight speed to the same number.

# Configuration
The `config.yml` file only contains 1 constant for you to change:
- `control` ID of the item which when held in hand activates the ZeusMod.
